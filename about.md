# About Me

I’m currently a security engineer at Duolingo, responsible for keeping its 
infrastructure secure. Before that, I was a software engineer on Two Sigma’s 
secure development team.

I earned my S.B. in Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3) from MIT in 2020. 
During my undergrad, I completed two software engineering internships at Google 
(2017, 2018) and research externships at IBM Research (2018) and Microsoft (2019).

Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, playing (electric) bass, running, 
messing around with computers, and baking. That said, I’m always trying 
something new!
