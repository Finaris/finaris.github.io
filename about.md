# About Me

I'm a security engineer at Duolingo. My current role has a broad set of responsbilities that all sum to making sure Duolingo's infrastructure is secure. Prior to my time at Duolingo, I worked as a security engineer on Two Sigma's security team.

I studied Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated in 2020. I interned twice at Google as a software engineer (2018, 2017). I was also involved in two brief research externships: one at Microsoft (2019) and another at IBM Research (2018).

Some of my personal interests include rock climbing, playing the electric bass, running, messing around with computers, cooking, and baking. That said, I'm always keeping an eye out for trying new things!
