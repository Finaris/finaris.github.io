# About Me

I'm currently an information security engineer. 
Previously, I was a security engineer at Duolingo and a software engineer on 
Two Sigma's secure development team.

I earned my S.B. in Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3) from MIT in 2020. 
During my undergrad, I completed two software engineering internships at Google 
and research externships at IBM Research and Microsoft.

Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, playing (electric) bass, running, 
messing around with computers, and baking. That said, I’m always trying 
something new!
