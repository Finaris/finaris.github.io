# About Me

I'm a security engineer at Two Sigma Investments, LP. Though most of my work is in application security, ensuring our code has minimal vulnerabilities, I also contribute to our cloud security efforts and recruitment. I studied Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated in 2020.

Prior to my full-time position (and internship in 2019) on Two Sigma's security engineering team, I interned twice at Google as a software engineer (2018, 2017). I was also involved in two brief research externships: one at Microsoft (2019) where I helped optimize a model for auto tagging Microsoft Office customer tickets and another at IBM Research (2018) where I parallelized an action recognition model using serverless functions.

Some of my personal interests include playing piano, running, messing around with hardware, lockpicking, cooking, and baking. That said, I'm always keeping an eye out for trying new things!
